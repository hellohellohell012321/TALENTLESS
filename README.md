# TALENTLESS – Open Source Repository

There are two versions of TALENTLESS: an open-source version and a closed-source version.

The closed-source version is the full release of TALENTLESS. It contains all 500+ songs and is the version distributed and loaded by users. This version is obfuscated with Luraph to prevent key system bypassing and to allow me to continue profiting from my work.

The open-source version is identical to the closed-source version in every way **except one**: it only includes 10 songs instead of 500+. That is the only difference, and it does not impact how developers or scripters can study and understand how TALENTLESS works.

This repository contains all of the original scripts used in the real TALENTLESS. The only modification is that the song index in `MAIN.lua` includes a limited number of songs.

## Why did I make this?

Simply put, to prevent key system bypassing.

The main script that contains the full song library is obfuscated so I can continue generating revenue while still providing a high-quality script for free. This repository exists so developers can study the structure and functionality of TALENTLESS without exposing the full distributed version.

If you're interested in how TALENTLESS functions internally, this repository is for you.

Please make sure to ask for permission before using, modifying, or distributing this code.
